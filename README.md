### Deploying the Action
This action uses [Firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) and [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/). It can be deployed to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) by running the `firebase deploy` command and by [importing the DialogFlow intents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents/export-import-restore) using the [zip file](DC-Metro.zip) found in the root of the repository. You'll also need to setup an environment variable within your functions configuration called `metro.apiKey` with an [API key from WMATA](https://developer.wmata.com/).


## Interactions ðŸ’¬
You're able to invoke the action using Google Assistant by saying `Hey Google, talk to DC Metro`, or by using one of the following commands.

| Action | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `Ok Google, Ask DC Metro for the Train timetable for Farragut North`  | You can ask the action for a rail or train timetable at a specific station. For instance you can say `Rail timetable for Farragut North` or `Train timetable for U Street`. Stations with acronyms in their name will also work, for example `Train timetable for George Mason University` will produce results even though the station name is GMU. |
| `Ask DC Metro for the Bus timetable for stop 3004076`  | You can ask the action for a bus stop timetable for a specific stop id. For instance you can say `Bus timetable for stop 123`. You can find the stop id on the sign that the bus stops at. |
| `Commands`  | You can ask the action for a list of available commands by saying either `train commands` or `bus commands`.  |

If you have a screen the action will send a detailed timetable to your device.
