[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/JamesIves/dc-metro-google-assistant-action/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/JamesIves/dc-metro-google-assistant-action/tree/master) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/JamesIves/dc-metro-google-assistant-action.svg)](https://github.com/JamesIves/dc-metro-google-assistant-action/issues)

This is a custom action for [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) which will tell you the current rail and bus predictions for the [DC Metro transit system](https://www.wmata.com/). These actions can be invoked on anything that supports Google Assistant such as a phone, a Google Home device, and the from the app. This action leverages the Metro API's. It's _not_ an official product provided by WMATA.

**You can view this application on the Google Assistant interaction directory [here](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000c72972063a?hl=en-US)**. ðŸ“¡

This application can be installed with Yarn by running `yarn install`. With the dependencies installed you can compile, lint and format the code base using the the following commands.

| Command | Description |

### Deploying the Action
This action uses [Firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) and [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/). It can be deployed to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) by running the `yarn deploy` command and by [importing the DialogFlow intents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents/export-import-restore) using the [zip file](DC-Metro.zip) found in the root of the repository. You'll also need to setup an environment variable within your functions configuration called `metro.apiKey` with an [API key from WMATA](https://developer.wmata.com/).


## Interactions ðŸ’¬
You're able to invoke the action using Google Assistant by saying `Hey Google, talk to DC Metro`, or by using one of the following commands.

| Action | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `Ok Google, Ask DC Metro for the Train times at Farragut North`  | You can ask the action for a rail or train timetable at a specific station. For instance you can say `Rail times for Farragut North` or `Train times for U Street`. Stations with acronyms in their name will also work, for example `Metro times for George Mason University` will produce results even though the station name is GMU. |
| `Ok Google, Ask DC Metro for the Bus times for stop 3004076`  | You can ask the action for a bus stop timetable for a specific stop id. For instance you can say `Bus times for stop 123`. You can find the stop id on the sign that the bus stops at. |
| `Ok Google, Ask DC Metro for Train Commands`  | You can ask the action for a list of available commands by saying either `train commands` or `bus commands`.  |

If you have a screen the action will send a detailed timetable to your device.
