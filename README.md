# DC Metro Google Action ðŸš‰ ðŸ”‰
This is a custom action for the Google Assistant which will tell you the current rail and bus predictions for the DC Metro transit system. These actions can be invoked on anything that supports Google Assistant such as the app, the Google Home product suite, Android phones, and more. 

## Interactions ðŸ’¬
You're able to invoke the DC Metro assistant by saying `Hey Google, talk to D.C. Metro` to Google Assistant on your device. From there you can ask it some questions:

`Hey Google, when will the next Train arrive at Farragut Square` ðŸ“¢

`Hey Google, when will the D9 Bus arrive at Farragut Square` ðŸ“¢

`Hey Google, Train timetable for Farragut Square North` ðŸ“¢
